  <h3>Updating Experiment Data</h3>

  There are a few common ways to update the database, depending on
  the context:

  <ul id="updating-methods">
    <li>
    <span><a href="{% url 'admin:index' %}">
        Django Admin Interface:</a></span>
    This ships with Django, and can be used for some simple updates.
    </li>

    <li>
    <span>Custom Interfaces:</span>

    Some interfaces were built to update the database in ways not easy
    handled by the Django admin.
    </li>

    <li>
    <span>Django Management Scripts:</span>

    These scripts are run from the command line, and should only be
    run after activating the project's Python virtualenv. As written,
    the commands below should be run from the project root.
    <br><br>
    To list all available scripts (organized by project app):
    <code class="clear">./manage.py help</code>

    To run a particular script:
    <code class="clear">./manage.py scriptname [args]</code>

    For help with a particular script, including arguments:
    <code class="clear">./manage.py help scriptname</code>

    For further help with a particular script, please consult the
    command's docstring.
    </li>

    <li>
    <span>Cron Jobs:</span>

    These jobs run automatically, in the crontab of the <code>eegi</code>
    user on pyxis.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <section>
    <h5>Add a single Experiment Plate</h5>

    Use the custom <a href="{% url 'add_experiment_plate_url' %}">
      Add Experiment Plate page</a>.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Add multiple Experiment Plates</h5>

    <code>./manage.py import_google_doc_data</code>

    This script works in concert with the
    <a href="{{ batch_data_entry_gdoc_url }}">
      {{ batch_data_entry_gdoc_name }}</a>
    Google Doc, which should be filled in prior to running the
    command.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Change one or more Experiment Plates</h5>

    Select the plates you would like to change using
    the filters on the
    <a href="{% url 'find_experiment_plates_url' %}">
      Find Experiment Plates page</a>.
    If you are logged in with the correct permissions,
    you will see a link at the bottom to "Change these plates".
    From there, you can change any plate-wide attributes.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Delete one or more Experiment Plates</h5>

    Use the Admin interface.

    NOTE: Deleting an Experiment Plate cascades to delete any
    associated Experiment Wells, Manual Scores, and Devstar Scores.
    Unless you are confident, marking junk may be preferred tactic.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Toggle junk on a single Experiment Well</h5>

    Go to the page for that experiment well
    (e.g., <a href="{% url 'experiment_well_url' '30010_A12' %}">
      here is 30010_A12</a>).
    If you are logged in with the correct permissions,
    you will see a button at the bottom to "Toggle Junk".
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Change Worm Strain or Library Stock on a
      single Experiment Well</h5>

    Use the Django admin (or develop a custom solution if this becomes
    common practice).
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Add/Update/Delete Manual Score Codes</h5>

    Use the Django admin.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Add Manual Scores</h5>

    <span class="error-message">
      TODO: build a general scoring interface for any primary and
      SUP secondary rescoring needs.
    </span>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Run DevStaR on new images (LG)</h5>

    Cron job.
    <span class="error-message">
      TODO: Lior is re-writing this for pyxis.
    </span>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Import DevStaR txt output into database</h5>

    <span class="error-message">
      TODO: Katherine needs to finish this after Lior finishes
      redoing some of the wrapper scripts.
    </span>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Update Experiment.gi_score field</h5>

    This script updates each experiment's "gi score",
    which is informed by its DevStaR output and that of its controls.

    You should run this script after adding or updating Experiments and/or
    DevStaR Scores.

    <span class="error-message">
      TODO: build this with Michelle
    </span>
  </section>

<section id="updating-lib">
  <h3>Changing Library & Clone Data</h3>

  <section>
    <h5>Update Clone mapping data</h5>

    <code>./manage.py import_mapping_data</code>

    This script connects to Firoz's RNAiCloneMapper database
    to update the gene mappings for the clones in this project.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Update Gene functional descriptions</h5>

    <code>./manage.py import_functional_descriptions</code>

    This script updates the functional descriptions of the Genes
    in this database, using a file of functional descriptions
    from WormBase.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Import sequencing data</h5>

    <code>./manage.py import_legacy_sequencing_data </code>

    This script imports sequencing data from the Genewiz dump on
    pleiades. It works in concert with a file specifying which
    Genewiz tracking numbers correspond to which sequencing plates,
    and with a reference of which library stocks correspond to
    which sequencing wells.

    <span class="error-message">TODO:
      The current script uses the legacy database as the reference
      for which library stocks correspond with which sequencing
      wells. It should be modified to work for sequencing needs
      going forward. The typical pipeline is to generate a
      cherrypick list as a CSV
      (in the standard source/destination format),
      do the cherrypicking, and then update the CSV
      for any changes/mistakes that occurred during cherrypicking.
      The plan is that this script should accept the finalized
      cherrypicking CSV.
    </span>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Import BLAT hits of sequencing data </h5>

    <code>./manage.py import_blat_results</code>

    This script adds the BLAT hits of our sequencing data
    to the database.

    <span class="error-message">TODO:
      Previously, Firoz performed the BLAT, and Katherine imported
      his txt results. We should modify Firoz's script to update
      the database directly.
    </span>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>Update LibraryStock.consensus_clone field</h5>

    <code>./manage.py ???</code>

    This script updates each library stock's "consensus clone",
    informed by our sequencing results. It should run after
    BLATing new sequencing results.

    <span class="error-message">TODO: build this once relevant
      decisions are made</span>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h5>
      Add/Update/Delete Clones, Library Plates, or Library Stocks
    </h5>

    Extremely infrequent. Update database directly or write
    a one-off script.
  </section>
