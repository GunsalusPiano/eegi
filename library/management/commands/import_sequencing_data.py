class Command(BaseCommand):
    """
    Command to import sequencing data.

    Arguments:

    - cherrypick_list is a csv with header row, listing which library
      stocks correspond to which sequencing wells. It should be in
      standard cherrypick list format, i.e., with four columns:
      `source_plate`, `source_well`, `destination_plate`, and
      `destination_well`. In this case, "source" is the library stock,
      and "destination" is the sequencing plate. E.g., if
      universal-F1_A12 was picked into sequencing plate JL42, well B09,
      the row would look like `universal-F1,A12,JL42,B09`.
      These files currently live in:

          materials/sequencing/cherrypick_lists

    - tracking_numbers is a csv with header row, containing the genewiz
      orders to be added. Three columns are needed, in any order:
      `order_date`, `tracking_number`, and `seq_plate`.
      These files currently live in:

          materials/sequencing/tracking_numbers

    - genewiz_output_root is the root directory where Genewiz dumps our
      sequencing data. Inside this directory are several Perl
      scripts that Huey-Ling used to make the Genewiz output more
      convenient to parse. The only one of these Perl scripts that is
      required to have been run before using this command is
      rmDateFromSeqAB1.pl, which removes the date from certain
      filenames. Otherwise, this script is flexible about dealing with
      Genewiz's Excel format, or Huey-Ling's text file format.
      This directory currently lives at:

          materials/sequencing/genewiz_dump/genewiz_data
